    <h1>Personal Information</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Artem. I was born in Russia and moved to Australia almost 9 years ago. I graduated high school in 2019 and took a gap year last year, which allowed me to travel the world, go to heaps of festivals and exhibitions, all in my imagination of course, because you know… Covid is a thing. Instead though, I managed to find a job in the midst of the first lockdown at a computer repair store, because all of a sudden everyone decided to fix their 12 year old computers to work from home and such stores capitalised on that. But hey, I’m not complaining. Getting this job allowed me to save up and move out from my mum’s house this year. So now I’ve been living independently for almost a month, or actually for a bit over a month by the time anyone reads this. Well, not fully independently, I do have a roommate, but our timetables aligned in such a way that I only see her in time to say good morning and sometimes even good night. At the moment, I’m trying to be healthier: started waking up at 6 (sometimes I allow myself to sleep in and wake up at 6:20), going to the gym, cooking my own food (but that’s mostly due to me having to budget everything a lot more thoroughly, I do kind of miss eating Macca’s everyday for breakfast, lunch and dinner) and stopped going out as much, which is pretty good for my liver. Just in case you wanted to know more about me (and in case this wasn’t enough to satisfy the rubric): my favourite colour is purple, favourite pets are cats and I have a dog and a cat (or well, my mum has a dog and a cat sinse I moved out, now I just have a grumpy roommate).</p>
