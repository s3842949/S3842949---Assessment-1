    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
      <h1>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h1>
       <p>I‚Äôve been interested in IT for as long as I remember. Both of my parents work in the IT industry, so I‚Äôm guessing, it carried over in DNA, and maybe growing up in such an environment played its role. IT has always been something I‚Äôve been passionate about, but the pivot point for me to actually get into it was when I was in year 8 and my friend asked me to help him choose parts for his computer and I wasn‚Äôt too sure as to what is actually better or worse or better value, and he said ‚ÄúOh, I thought you were good with computers, I‚Äôll ask someone else.‚Äù And from that point I started reading and learning about computers and the IT world, because no one gets to tell me what I‚Äôm good and bad at (except for you ‚Ä¶! Please let me know if any of this was no good and I‚Äôll improve). And the more I learnt, the more I wanted to learn, as it‚Äôs just so interesting: hardware, software, cloud, security, cloud security‚Ä¶ you name it! I absolutely cannot say that I know everything or even a lot, there‚Äôs simply way way too much to learn, but my passion eventually landed my a job at a computer repair store, which I love working at. What keeps me interested now is the prospect of technology in the future, how it can help humanity grow as a whole, as long as we don‚Äôt use it to wipe each other out from the face of the Earth, which becomes more and more realistic each day. It‚Äôs definitely the future, what we have now is just the beginning and I want to be a part of this great world of IT.</p>

      <h1>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h1>
       <p>Most people are probably saying that ‚ÄúI chose to study at RMIT, because I didn‚Äôt get into Monash bruv lolololol‚Äù and I‚Äôm no different, but I want to elaborate. Monash was indeed my first preference, it seems like a good university and most of my friends were going there. But why did I put RMIT as my second preference? From what I‚Äôve heard, RMIT is good at teaching from the very basics of the course. That appealed to me as there are some aspects of this course that I don‚Äôt have that much background information about, such as working with databases, which I‚Äôve only done in year 9 using Microsoft Access, not only do I not remember anything, at RMIT for example, we have to use SQLite and actually write things in SQL, which I have zero knowledge about. So it‚Äôs nice to have a refresher and time to catch up in things I didn‚Äôt previously know. RMIT is also told to be a good university for IT related course. I reckon Bachelor of Information Technology has something to do with IT, so that‚Äôs another good reason to choose RMIT. It‚Äôs also not too hard for me to get to RMIT, for the one class a week I have on campus, it doesn‚Äôt take me too long and I only have to change a single train line along the way (although Monash would just be a single 20-minute bus ride for me üòä).</p>

      <h1>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h1>
       <p>I‚Äôll hopefully at least learn some of the things I‚Äôm taught. Just kidding. During my studies, I hope to learn everything I‚Äôm taught. I don‚Äôt really have anything specific I want to learn, everything in this course is useful in one way or another. There are some things that I find more interesting than others, such as programming > databases, but I would still love to learn and understand both of those things. Maybe, throughout the course I‚Äôll change my opinion and will see certain things more useful for my future, but for now, I believe everything I‚Äôm taught is useful, so I expect to learn everything this course throws at me: SQL, Python, even Chinese if need be‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll do my best to learn it all.</p>
