      <h1>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h1>
       <p>I agree with the results I have gotten. I’d say that I’m mostly an introverted person around new people. I usually don’t speak out that much and stick to the people I know. However, in a group of people I already know and that I’m comfortable with, I can sometimes be the loudest out of everyone and sometimes a bit too hyper. I definitely enjoy my ‘me time’ and find it much more relaxing than spending time with my friends as it usually tires me out. It’s one of the things I’m currently working on improving: trying to talk to more new people and being myself around them as well. I agree that I’m mostly intuitive. I stay open-minded, whether it’s a project I’m working on, an argument I’m having or a real world issue or, I always try to understand all sides of the story and ask questions to understand the other person better rather than convince them that I’m right (although I’m usually right). I do try to be more rational rather than emotional. It doesn’t always work out and my primal brain takes over, but I definitely try to stay think things through rather than act impulsively. My ‘tactics’ results came very close to being 50/50 between judging and prospecting. I can understand that. Although I try to stay organised, regularly make to-do lists and plan things in advance in my calendar, I can easily get distracted, like to procrastinate and can leave things until the last moment. But even if I may come off as lazy because of that, in the end, I do everything I was supposed to, even if it means I have to pull an all-nighter to finish my work. I agree that I’m mostly turbulent. I can easily get anxious in unfamiliar situations and there are definitely many things I’m self-conscious about, but recently I’ve started working on improving this aspect of my life. I started trying to put myself in uncomfortable situations and hide any signs of discomfort I’m having to prove to myself that everything is much simpler in the real-world rather than my head. I definitely agree that I am an auditory learner. I find it way easier to concentrate on new information if it’s read out to me or presented in a video rather than me having to read it. I still enjoy reading and am still able to remember the things I’m reading about, but if I have to learn something that’s not that interesting to me, I get easily distracted. I’ve agreed on all of the results I’ve gotten so fat, but I kind of disagree with my ‘Workplace Personality Quiz’ results. It describes me as a ‘Guardian’ who is ‘not one to speak up in meetings unless (I’m) entirely sure of (myself)’. I often enjoy adding my views and opinions to team conversations, even if they might be wrong, as I always want to hear other people’s take on my input, to improve my views in case they were a bit off, or to give the team as a whole more to work with.</p>

      <h1>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h1>
       <p>According to these results, I’ll be open-minded and take other people’s opinion on how to tackle the project into account, I will also want to assign myself parts of the project that I would want to complete and work on them independently where I can. I would take my time to thing, wouldn’t speak up unless I was 100% sure what I was about to say is fitting and right. I would be organised, even if I could slack off a little at times. This doesn’t exactly describe how I would actually work in a team environment. Although I agree that I would prefer to work independently, I would never do so if it had a negative impact on the project we would be working on. If the project requires collaboration, I will definitely put all my efforts in to communicate with others and solve issues together. I wouldn’t be afraid to speak out, even if I could be wrong. I do agree that I would be mostly organised, but could procrastinate a little now and then, but would still definitely finish all the work I was supposed to do and wouldn’t give in to my laziness if it affected the team.</p>

      <h1>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h1>
       <p>When forming a team, ideally, I would want to work with people who think similarly to myself. In the past, I haven’t come across many people of that sort. I shouldn’t explicitly look for such people and definitely shouldn’t expect to find them. In a more realistic scenario, I reckon I would work best with people who are not too introverted, but not too extraverted either: not people who wouldn’t try and hide from everyone and be afraid to add anything to the team but also not people who would try to be the centre of attention, loud and annoying. I would work best with people who can provide input for the team to work with, who wouldn’t try and do as little as they possibly can and who wouldn’t be anxious or shy to talk. I believe these are the sort of people that, according to my results, I would work best with.</p>
